# az-tf-mlz-template

The template for Fortytwo's managed landing zone (MLZ) Terraform modules, `az-tf-mlz-<name>`: AzAPI
only, shaped like the Azure Verified Modules (AVM) AzAPI modules, without telemetry.

## Start a module from this template

1. Create the repository from the template and apply the repository settings:

   ```sh
   gh repo create fortytwoservices/az-tf-mlz-<name> --internal --template fortytwoservices/az-tf-mlz-template --clone
   cd az-tf-mlz-<name>
   scripts/repo-settings.sh fortytwoservices/az-tf-mlz-<name>
   ```

2. On a branch, replace the placeholder module (below) with the real one: root files, `modules/*`,
   `examples/*` and the tests. Rewrite this `_header.md`; keep `_footer.md`.
3. Run `scripts/check.sh --fix`, then the Azure tests, and open a pull request whose title starts with
   `feat:`. Merging it makes release-please open the release pull request for the first version.

## The placeholder module

A user-assigned identity with federated identity credentials. It is here to keep every pattern a
module needs working and tested:

- the primary resource `azapi_resource.this`, with `resource_types`, `ignore_body_changes`, `retry`,
  `timeouts` and `tags`;
- a child resource type as a submodule managing one instance (`modules/federated_identity_credential`),
  called with `for_each` by the root, with its writes serialised on the parent (`locks`);
- the lock and role assignment interfaces through `Azure/avm-utl-interfaces/azure`, with the pause that
  lets a deleted lock propagate before anything else is destroyed;
- unit tests with mocked providers, integration tests in Azure, and an example that is applied,
  planned again (no changes allowed) and destroyed.
